# MTN-Customer-Churn-Analysis
## Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed a sample dataset of MTN Nigeria’s customer churn for the first quarter of 2025. The analysis focused on understanding revenue performance and identifying key churn patterns and drivers. Below are the key insights:
•	Total Revenue from Mobile Data Sales: ₦119 million
•	Total Customer Churn: 284 customers, representing 29% of the total customer base
•	State with the Highest Revenue: Plateau State – ₦9.4 million (4.7% of total revenue)
•	Peak Revenue Month: February – ₦52 million (43.7% of total revenue)
•	Peak Customer Churn Month: February – 142 customers (50% of total churn)
•	Leading Churn Reason: High call tariff, accounting for 19% of total churn cases
This analysis highlights a strong correlation between peak revenue and churn in February, suggesting a potential dissatisfaction among high-paying users. The insights can be used to inform customer retention strategies, particularly around pricing.
